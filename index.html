    <h1>The Emotion Project</h1>
    <h2>What is emotion?</h2>
<p>While endlessly looking for definitions of the word ‘emotion’, we
    found that science has had a hard time defining the term.</p>
    
<p>According to Rosalind W. Picard, Sc.D., FIEEE, Director of Affective
Computing Research at MIT Media Lab, "Emotion is like Everest:
Theories and definitions of emotion exist in great abundance, and
yet it is still hard to say whether or not a particular thing is emotion,
much like climbers at the base of Mount Everest might argue as to
whether a particular rock is a part of Everest. The fact is, you can't
define Mt. Everest precisely; however, you can still say precise things
about it.</p>
